<h2> What does it take for a small business to hire an employee with the Affordable Care Act in place? </h2>
<br>
<br>

<p> There are a lot of people in America that think the Affordable Care Act is a disaster. They specifically mention the regulations that it puts on employers to provide health insurance for full-time employees. From what I can tell, small businesses with less than 50 employees are exempt from this requirement. Is this the case? Does the Affordable Care Act have any regulations that affect a small business? </p>
 
 <p> In this situation I am thinking of a small business that is not going to offer health insurance to any of its employees.  Perhaps a golf course or landscaping company. Most of their employees will be part time anyway. Should they be worried about employees working full time hours during the busy season? And beyond just health care, what other regulations must a small business comply with to hire a new employee? Do these regulations frequently become burdensome to the business? I would really like to hear some good investigative journalism on these questions. </p>
